\title{
Folds a numerical number at 180.
}
\description{
Limits a numerical vector to 180. If an element in the vector is greater than 180 then the amount it is greater than 180 by is subtracted from it. Useful for angles between two vectors, if the angle between two vectors is 180 degrees this is the maximum difference -- once the angle exceeds 180 degrees the vectors begin to converge again.
